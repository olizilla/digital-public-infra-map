"1","Interoperable and extensible","Technology","Interoperability refers to the ability of digital systems and components to communicate with each other, reflecting the ‘infrastructure’ nature of the technology.\nExtensibility refers to the ability of the technology to be foundational and bare-bones, such that it can be stretched to build its functionality as needed. It reflects the relevance of the technology to a diverse set of public and private actors using it as infrastructure to serve societal outcomes.\nDPI can also favour modularity, reflecting its composition of a set of building blocks that can be put together or broken apart as necessary. It can also be federated and decentralised, to allow an amalgamated set of services to serve one function.\nTechnology with both open as well as closed (or proprietary) source code can be interoperable and extensible. However, the norm of interoperability favours open standards so as to facilitate higher adoption among more actors in a consensus-driven way"
"2","Transparency, accountability and oversight","Public-interest values","Transparency reflects the quality of DPI being open and accessible regarding its processes and outputs throughout the design and adoption process.\nAccountability and oversight reflect the role of system operators and governors in ensuring that the digital technology, now essential to the functions of society, can be trusted by its users and by society at large. It implies accountable design through technology’s design features, as well as external accountability as ensured through oversight by legal actors in society."
"3","Privacy, safety and security","Public-interest values","Given the inherent access that DPI has to personal information and data, protecting this information against threats to privacy, safety and security of individuals is a necessary norm for DPI to be trusted by its users."
"4","Non-discrimination and inclusion","Public-interest values","DPI can exacerbate existing issues around individual access to basic services, curtailing human rights. For DPI to be inclusively designed, it needs to not only accommodate peripheral access, but keep inclusive design at the centre of its philosophy."
"5","Capacity and coordination","Adoption","Reflects the institutional arrangement within which the implementation of DPI is housed. For states, this refers to the novel and existing capacity that needs to be developed to respond to the DPI mandate. This capacity could house the DPI itself or be tasked with coordinating with non-state actors to implement the DPI."
"6","Scale of adoption","Adoption","The adoption of DPI by multiple agencies for public service delivery is an intrinsic DPI norm because it reflects the success of its ‘infrastructure’ potential. This attribute also hints at the interoperability, reflecting whether agencies (state or non-state) other than the one where the DPI is housed, can communicate with this piece of infrastructure."
