# Community

The DPI Measurement CoP brings together the diverse stakeholder community around DPI to develop a common language and shared practices for effective measurement. At its core, the CoP seeks to:

- Strengthen **collective expertise** in DPI measurement through regular knowledge sharing
- Address key **research questions** relevant to building measurement frameworks for DPI assessment and evaluation
- Contribute to ongoing **governance and research initiatives** (including the Universal DPI Safeguards Working Group, G20 DEWG outputs, DPI Map)

## Previous Sessions

### Session 6 - Governance Challenges in Digital Public Infrastructure: Evidence from Financial Services Integration

- **Regulatory Silos Fail to Capture DPI Complexity**: Traditional sectoral boundaries prove inadequate for governing interconnected identity, payment, and data systems. Effective oversight requires coordination across financial regulators, identity authorities, and data protection agencies that existing frameworks struggle to facilitate.
- **Comprehensive DPI Correlates with Inclusion**: CCAF research reveals substantial improvements in credit access, government transfer effectiveness, and emergency fund availability in jurisdictions with mature three-component DPI systems. However, these benefits remain contingent on addressing persistent digital divides.
- **Natural Monopoly Dynamics Create Governance Tensions**: DPI's network effects and interoperability requirements generate market concentration concerns, with participants highlighting conflicts of interest when central banks serve simultaneously as infrastructure operators and regulators.
- **Technological Evolution Poses New Regulatory Challenges**: AI integration, blockchain adoption, and digital wallet expansion introduce governance uncertainties that existing DPI frameworks cannot adequately address, risking fragmentation of global interoperability.
- **Digital Sovereignty Shapes Infrastructure Choices**: Countries increasingly view DPI ownership through national security lenses, affecting vendor selection and cross-border data flows in ways that could fragment technical standards and limit international cooperation.

### Session 5 - Measuring "Just" DPI

* **Measurement Shapes Reality:** The metrics we choose don't just describe DPI impacts, they actively shape funding priorities, design decisions, and ultimately determine who benefits from digital infrastructure.  
* **From Upward to Outward Accountability:** Effective DPI measurement must shift from metrics designed for government reporting to frameworks that capture lived experiences and developmental outcomes for citizens.
* **Justice as Measurement Framework:** Adopting data justice principles such as representation, rights, and redress, provides more meaningful evaluation criteria than technical indicators alone.
* **Qualitative Evidence Matters:** The supremacy of quantitative metrics in policy spaces obscures critical insights about exclusion that only emerge through ethnographic and experiential research methods.
* **Measuring What's Missing:** The most important DPI impacts may be those we're not measuring because they're harder to fund, including dignity, agency, and the hidden labour of navigating digital systems.

### Session 4 - Addressing Safety and Security in Digital Public Infrastructure

* **Safety and Security Measurement Requires New Frameworks:** Current DPI measurement approaches inadequately capture security and resilience needs. Effectively addressing this challenge will require new frameworks that account for the full life cycle of public infrastructure.  
* **Governance Challenges Exceed Technical Solutions**: Real-world implementation reveals that regulatory frameworks, institutional mandates, and cross-agency coordination present greater barriers than technical security controls.    
* **Operational Principles Must Bridge High-Level Values**: Translating broadly agreed principles like "security by design" into measurable, operational frameworks remains a critical gap requiring evidence-based approaches and real-world case studies. 
* **Capacity Building Enables Informed Risk Decisions**: Creating "intelligent customers" who can make informed security decisions is essential for sustainable DPI deployment, requiring frameworks that translate technical concepts into actionable governance choices.

### Session 3 - Towards Robust Metrics for Trust in DPI

How do you measure success when the metrics themselves might be part of the problem?

The session showcased research that addresses critical gaps in how we understand and measure the ongoing effectiveness of DPI projects. APTI Institute‚Äôs Asta Kapoor and Kunal Raj Banua demonstrated how India‚Äôs celebrated adoption numbers mask a more complex reality of limited sustained usage and trust deficits. Data Privacy Brazil‚Äôs Rafael Zanatta approached similar questions with evidence from Brazil‚Äôs gov.br platform, where record-breaking user statistics obscure systematic exclusions, from undocumented citizens to transgender individuals, while inadvertently enabling widespread fraud.

### Session 2 - Measuring Interoperability

_Measuring What Matters: Insights on DPI Interoperability from Global Experts_

- **Standards-Interoperability Relationship is Contextual**: As systems mature and ecosystems need to connect, explicit standards become essential for maintaining interoperability at scale. Effective DPI measurement approaches must work to assess different maturity stages and prioritise real-world outcomes over rigid compliance metrics.
- **Testing as Research:** Creating empirical tests that directly measure system compatibility provides more usable metrics than theoretical assessments. Real-world compatibility tests offer a way to transform abstract interoperability standards into measurable outcomes that reflect actual user experiences.
- **Compliance with Purpose**: Interoperability should be measured against its ability to deliver tangible value rather than technical compliance. Measurement frameworks should prioritize service continuity, reduced transaction costs, and cross-border functionality over standards adherence.
- **Interoperability is Multidimensional**: Effective measurement must consider technical, syntactic, semantic, and legal dimensions of interoperability. Each dimension presents unique challenges and requires different assessment approaches to capture both capabilities and limitations.

### Session 1 - Inclusion

There is an increasing need to make transparent how DPI embodies the normative values it claims to represent. Inclusion stands at the heart of this challenge, offering a litmus test for whether DPI can achieve population-scale outcomes while preserving public values.

The session brought together researchers, policymakers, technical providers, and civil society representatives to explore a critical question: _how can we effectively measure whether DPI systems are genuinely inclusive in both design and impact?_
