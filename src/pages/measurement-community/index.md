# Community

This **community of practice (CoP)** for DPI measurement aims to bring together practitioners, researchers, and policymakers to collaboratively develop more nuanced, context-sensitive approaches to DPI assessment and evaluation.

The next session is **May 6 2025** on the theme of **Interoperability**.

We meet via Zoom. [Register here](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/cD9gPKuQR7WiDYB3ZNSS-g#/registration) to attend.


## Goals

The DPI Measurement CoP brings together the diverse stakeholder community around DPI to develop a common language and shared practices for effective measurement. At its core, the CoP seeks to:

- Strengthen **collective expertise** in DPI measurement through regular knowledge sharing
- Address key **research questions** relevant to building measurement frameworks for DPI assessment and evaluation
- Contribute to ongoing **governance and research initiatives** (including the Universal DPI Safeguards Working Group, G20 DEWG outputs, DPI Map)

## Previous Sessions

### April 09, 2025 - Inclusion

There is an increasing need to make transparent how DPI embodies the normative values it claims to represent. Inclusion stands at the heart of this challenge, offering a litmus test for whether DPI can achieve population-scale outcomes while preserving public values.

The session brought together researchers, policymakers, technical providers, and civil society representatives to explore a critical question: _how can we effectively measure whether DPI systems are genuinely inclusive in both design and impact?_
