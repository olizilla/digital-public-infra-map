# Community

This **community of practice (CoP)** for DPI measurement aims to bring together practitioners, researchers, and policymakers to collaboratively develop more nuanced, context-sensitive approaches to DPI assessment and evaluation.

The next session is **July 16, 12:00 BST (midday)** on the theme of **Trust, Safety and Security**.

We meet via Zoom. [Register here](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/oQiCoJvcSx-MfNjqL7Nojw) to attend.

## Goals

The DPI Measurement CoP brings together the diverse stakeholder community around DPI to develop a common language and shared practices for effective measurement. At its core, the CoP seeks to:

*   Strengthen **collective expertise** in DPI measurement through regular knowledge sharing
    
*   Address key **research questions** relevant to building measurement frameworks for DPI assessment and evaluation
    
*   Contribute to ongoing **governance and research initiatives** (including the Universal DPI Safeguards Working Group, G20 DEWG outputs, DPI Map)

### Session 2 - Measuring Interoperability

_Measuring What Matters: Insights on DPI Interoperability from Global Experts_

*   **Standards-Interoperability Relationship is Contextual**: As systems mature and ecosystems need to connect, explicit standards become essential for maintaining interoperability at scale. Effective DPI measurement approaches must work to assess different maturity stages and prioritise real-world outcomes over rigid compliance metrics.
    
*   **Testing as Research:** Creating empirical tests that directly measure system compatibility provides more usable metrics than theoretical assessments. Real-world compatibility tests offer a way to transform abstract interoperability standards into measurable outcomes that reflect actual user experiences.
    
*   **Compliance with Purpose**: Interoperability should be measured against its ability to deliver tangible value rather than technical compliance. Measurement frameworks should prioritize service continuity, reduced transaction costs, and cross-border functionality over standards adherence.
    
*   **Interoperability is Multidimensional**: Effective measurement must consider technical, syntactic, semantic, and legal dimensions of interoperability. Each dimension presents unique challenges and requires different assessment approaches to capture both capabilities and limitations.

### Session 1 - Inclusion

There is an increasing need to make transparent how DPI embodies the normative values it claims to represent. Inclusion stands at the heart of this challenge, offering a litmus test for whether DPI can achieve population-scale outcomes while preserving public values.

The session brought together researchers, policymakers, technical providers, and civil society representatives to explore a critical question: _how can we effectively measure whether DPI systems are genuinely inclusive in both design and impact?_
