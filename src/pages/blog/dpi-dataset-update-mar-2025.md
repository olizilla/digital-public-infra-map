# DPI Dataset Update

The DPI Map Team is delighted to share that a new dataset update is [now live](https://dpimap.org/dpimap) on our website. Since our initial launch in October 2024, our team captured a first glance of government efforts to deploy federal level DPI systems: digital identity, digital payment, and data exchange systems across 210 countries. Our latest update offers new insights into the evolving landscape of digital public infrastructure worldwide and what you can find with our latest changes.

## Whatâ€™s changed on the map?

Our latest updated dataset includes several formatting changes providing a more comprehensive outline of DPI developments.

- **Updated Deployment Statuses**: The current implementation statuses have been regrouped into two fixed statuses to provide a clearer view of each country's DPI deployments and their statuses:
  - **Planned/Piloted** - Systems in planning or pilot testing phases.
  - **Implemented Digital tools have been deployed to the public.**
- **System vs Sub-system Variables**: We've added differentiation between country-level and system-level technical details, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of each deployment.
- **Time Stamped Data**: Weâ€™ve included a new column to see countries that have been updated with new information. You can expect new dataset updates every quarter.

## DPI Highlights: Country-level updates

The following includes some of the added information to the latest dataset.

- ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¿Â **Tanzaniaâ€™s _Jamii X-Change_** is designed to facilitate interoperability between platforms, encompassing three key modules: Jamii Namba, Jamii Kadi, Jamii Malipo, enabling secure data sharing between public and private organizations.
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿Â **Azerbaijan**â€™s _Digital Login_ system streamlines access to over 150 government portals through a single sign-on mechanism, enhancing user convenience and security. The system offers multiple authentication methods, including facial recognition, simplifying the identification process and improving citizen satisfaction.

Additionally, the _CIE (Carta d'IdentitÃ  Elettronica)_ also serves as an electronic identity card, providing official identification, facilitating access to online services.
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­Â **Switzerland**â€™s latest central payment infrastructure, _Swiss Interbank Clearing 5 (SIC5),_ real-time gross settlement (RTGS), enables instant payments, allowing individuals and businesses to complete transactions instantly.
