## Executive Summary

In the past two years, digital public infrastructure (DPI) has
emerged as a global priority, shaping the conversation around
how governments and societies can benefit from technology
and the role of the state in this journey. As more advocacy
and funding for DPI increase, and more governments take an
interest in this approach, a gap has emerge.

The DPI Map and its associated methodology were established
to address this by providing a baseline of prevalence.

This report builds on that effort to do four things:

First, it asserts a **growing consensus around the definition
of DPI** centered around **3 societal functions and 6 common
attributes.**

Second, it provides a **current snapshot of the prevalence of DPI**.
Looking at DPI’s three components—digital ID, digital payments,
and data exchange systems—the IIPP’s DPI Map establishes
the first global snapshot of DPI systems across 210 countries.
As of 2025, at least **64 countries have DPI-like digital ID
systems, 97 countries have DPI-like digital payment systems,
and 103 countries have DPI-like data exchange systems.**

Third, it analyses what these patterns reveal about **DPI’s
evolution**. Our findings reveal significant **unevenness across
global regions**, with **identifiable maturity clusters and income-
level patterns shaping implementation**. **Interoperability
and adoption** often progress together, suggesting an
interdependence between system design and real-world uptake.

Finally, we share reflections on the **state of measurement of
DPI**, and suggest areas for further research. As many existing
measurement approaches rely on proxies for understanding DPI
attributes, such as technical specifications and the presence
of legal frameworks, they often paint a narrow picture of how
systems function in practice, and don’t capture the extent to
which governance is enforced. There is still much to be done to
adequately assess the efficacy of DPI, and the building blocks
of measurement being constructed today lay the groundwork
for increasingly rigorous assessment in the years ahead.

### The State of Defining DPI

**Finding #1:** There’s a growing consensus around DPI’s definition and attributes, often focusing on 3 societal functions and 6 common attributes.

### What the DPI Map Data is Telling Us

**Finding #2:** DPI is not distributed evenly between regions across the world.

**Finding #3:** The map’s listed attributes reveal varying pathways to developing DPI.

**Finding #4:** Attributes countries invest in correlate with income level.

**Finding #5:** Interoperability and adoption are correlated.


### The Limits of Measurement and The Challenges Those Pose

**Finding #6:** Despite progress on measuring DPI, it’s unclear whether it correlates with performance.

**Finding #7:** Governance measurements identify the prevalence of legal frameworks and oversight bodies but cannot assess enforcement capacity.

**Finding #8:** Adoption metrics are diverse, and data availability is lacking.

## Next steps

[Help map DPI](/contribute-to-the-dpi-map) and join the [Community of Practice](/measurement-community)

We invite all who are interested to join the IIPP Community
of Practice on DPI Measurement. Participants can join virtual sessions in this open
forum and propose new topics for exploration via a short
session proposal form. Topics range from ways to measure
interoperability to inclusivity, often featuring presentations from
experts in their respective fields. Insights from sessions are
published on our blog, helping to share lessons across contexts.

Participants are encouraged to subscribe to the [DPI Map newsletter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSef0ja9DQhV9uBpgSBILh0eNT152Y2nv_9DRGZNFqulZT09Eg/viewform) to receive updates on upcoming sessions, new dataset releases, and the latest analysis from the IIPP digital
team and our collaborators.
