Use the [Measuring DPI framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-G3Jmo85tABaBLyg1UPXtzUKK8NK3VH4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109666902899934821981&rtpof=true&sd=true) to review of the state of DPI in your country of interest, and [share with with us](https://forms.gle/k3zqfXVENMbpsKDp7)

## Improve the framework

[Book a meeting](https://calendly.com/ucbvkra-ucl/dpimap). Help us measure better. We are always interested in new and viable ways to measure DPI.
