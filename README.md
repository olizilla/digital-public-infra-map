## Getting started

**Editors:** You can edit the site via [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org/).

**The bold and the curious:** You can build this website on your computer:

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- Download the code by cloning this repo
- Run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to build the site and start a local server
- Open http://localhost:4321 in your browser

You can now add new pages and edit existing ones and see those changes live in your browser.
